# Lab
A repository for the needs of the Software Eningineering in Practice (SEiP) course offered by the Department of Management Science & Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business.

# Project Structure
This repository consists of a parent Maven project and one sub-project (modules), Histogram Generator.

# Histogram Generator
This module requires one runtime dependency which is packaged in the main jar (fat-jar).

The produced jar is located in the target directory and can be executed as following:

java -jar gradeshistogram/target/gradeshistogram-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar grades.txt

Note that the gradeshistogram-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar is not executable.

# Arithmetic Operations

This is a Java project serving as a brief demonstration for Unit Testing for the needs of the lab tutorials of the [Software Engineering in Practice](https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/sweng-en/) course. It makes use of Maven to automate the build process of the two available modules.

# Design Patterns assignment's code base

Î¤his repository is used to practice the implementation of design patterns, in the context of the 4th Lab Assignment of the Applied Software Engineering course.

The code refers to a software system that reads a Java source code file that is stored locally or on the web, calculates the Lines of Code (LOC), Number of Classes (NOC) and Number of Methods (NOM) metrics, and finally, exports these metrics to an output file.

The purpose of the assignment is to modify the code and implement some design patterns, in order to improve the design quality of the system.
